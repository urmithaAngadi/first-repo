🎥 Ways to Introduce Solutions Smoothly

Contrast Technique

After showing the problem (huge water use in cosmetics), switch to:
“But what if beauty didn’t have to come at the cost of our water?”

Then introduce sustainable alternatives.

“What If” Scenario

Transition with a hopeful line:
“Imagine a world where your shampoo isn’t 80% water… but still works just as well.”

This leads you into waterless products and eco-friendly habits.

Consumer’s Role

After showing problems, say:
“We might not stop factories overnight, but we can start with the choices we make every day.”

Then naturally move into eco-friendly swaps.

Storytelling with Visuals

Problem: show water being wasted in production.

Transition: show a hand turning off a dripping tap.

Narration: “Saving water doesn’t always mean giving up beauty—it means choosing smarter beauty.”

Then highlight solutions.

Hopeful Tone Shift

Problem segment: darker visuals, heavier tone.

When moving to solutions: brighter visuals, uplifting music, fresh colors.

Narration example:
“The good news? There are better ways forward.”
